This is the classic Snake game but made by me.

There is not much to talk about, you can choose the map and the speed of the game.
To move you can use your arrow keys or W,A,S,D and to restart there is a button on screen
with an R, you can press it or you can just press R on your keyboard both of them have the 
same purpose.

Once you start the game you will see the board, with the snake, the food you have to eat
as a red square and eventualy will apear a yellow one which is the super foood; Also on
the game's window you can find the "Edit" button to change the configuration you aplied
to the game and "About" to get more information about the game.

The scoring system is easy, the normal food equals to a single point and the super food
to three points, if the snake hits herself or the end of the board, the game will be over.

There is nothing else to explain, just play and enjoy. If you have any problem, recomendation
or idea about the game, let me know so i can fix and improve the game.
